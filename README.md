## Identify Data Problem

- [x] Title Generation

## Data acquisition & Preprocessing

- [x] Data Scraper & Sentence Tokenizer: modify code from [this repo](https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail).
- [x] [Split Article & Highlight](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/Refresh).
- [x] Data can be downloaded from this link(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SpXFHpWWrq1wGZ8ASfhd14I3-qpAb6_I?usp=sharing).


## Data Exploration (By the end of Week 11).

- [x] Visualization: Length, word frequency(visualize, (word cloud)...)

- [x] Statistics(train/dev/test: 1200/400/400--choose only in DailyMail(score might be higher).

Resources:

- Text analytics library: [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/book/)

## Data Analysis (By the end of Week 10)

## Hyper-Parameter Tuning (By the end of week 11).

Hyper parameters: 
- [x] learning rate (alto adjusted by the function), 
- [x] number of epochs (No significant improvement after n>=5), 
- [x] batch size (Limited due to memory size), 
- [x] size of training data (No significant improvement after n>400,000),
- [x] optimizer (best optimizer = 1e-4).
