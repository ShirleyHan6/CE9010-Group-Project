This repository contains the group project for CE9010

## Time line (Week 10 - Week 13)

- By the end of week 10:

## Identify Data Problem

- [x] Extractive Summarizer

## Data acquisition & Preprocessing

- [x] Data Scraper & Sentence Tokenizer: modify code from [this repo](https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail).
- [x] [Split Article & Highlight](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/Refresh).
- [x] Data can be downloaded from this link(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SpXFHpWWrq1wGZ8ASfhd14I3-qpAb6_I?usp=sharing).

## Data Exploration: DZ, Glenn(By the end of Week 11).

- [x] Visualization: Length, word frequency(visualize, (word cloud)...)

- [x] Statistics(train/dev/test: 1200/400/400--choose only in DailyMail(score might be higher).

Resources:

- Text analytics library: [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/book/)

## Data Analysis: YB, Simeng(By the end of Week 10)

- [x] [Model](https://machinelearningmastery.com/encoder-decoder-models-text-summarization-keras/)(in progress).
- [x] [A more comprehensive introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-data-products-that-are-magical-using-sequence-to-sequence-models-703f86a231f8)
- [x] First Version by Week 10 Saturday.
- [x] Export to [Google Collab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t3HqTZ6D4v2CJ290j-x44YKyBcjrY2rf?usp=sharing). [This repo](https://github.com/anqitu/NTUOSS-ImageRecognitionWorkshop) has a nice introduction of how to use Google Collab for Data Science projects.
- [x] [Set up a server](https://github.com/cs231n/gcloud). - by Week 10 Sunday (need to discuss environment) https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?project=ce9010-course-project&organizationId=0

## Evaluation Metric YB, Simeng (By the end of Week 10)

- [x] Error metric: [ROUGE](https://github.com/ShirleyHan6/CE9010-Group-Project/tree/master/Evaluation).

## Hyper-Parameter Tuning: YB, DZ & Glenn (By the end of week 11).

Hyper parameters: 
- [ ] number of layers, 
- [ ] activation function, 
- [x] learning rate (alto adjusted by the function), 
- [x] number of epochs (No significant improvement after n>=5), 
- [x] batch size (Limited due to memory size), 
- [x] size of training data (No significant improvement after n>400,000),
- [x] optimizer (best optimizer = 1e-4).

## Result Interpretation & Conclusion (By the end of week 12).

- [ ] Error Analysis
